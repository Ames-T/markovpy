MarkovPy
======================

A lightweight Python library for working with discrete-time Markov chains,
with a focus on clarity, mathematical correctness, and inspectable algorithms.

The project provides:
- A core ``Chain`` class for representing Markov chains
- Algorithms for simulation, reachability, and state analysis
- A small, well-documented API aimed at learning and experimentation

If you are coming from a mathematical background, the documentation is written
to closely mirror standard notation while remaining idiomatic Python.
