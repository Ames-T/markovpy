Overview
========

``markovpy`` is designed as a minimal but expressive toolkit for experimenting
with finite Markov chains.

The library emphasizes:
- Explicit state spaces
- Transparent transition matrices
- Algorithms that reflect standard theoretical results

This makes it particularly suitable for educational use and prototyping.
